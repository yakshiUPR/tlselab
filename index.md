## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yakshiUPR/tlselab/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yakshiUPR/tlselab/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

I am currently coursing my fourth year as a biology undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. I am excited to be researching for my third consecutive year at the TLSE Lab. I started as a volunteer towards the end of my freshman year and then continued through the Introduction to Research course. In the lab, I work with tree cores to characterize tree growth patterns and infer climate conditions.

My work in the lab focuses on plant functional traits, namely root tensile strength and its abiotic and biotic influences. As part of my undergraduate thesis, I am compiling the first global root tensile strength database which will help strengthen our knowledge of belowground interactions and ecosystem processes.

I am an undergraduate Biology student at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras. This is my 2nd year as a member of the TLSE lab where I work on characterizing the functional diversity of plant communities developing on landslides. This lies within my research interests as I am interested in studying how plant communities are influenced by their environment and disturbances.

Yakshi did her BS and her MSc. in the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras. Her thesis focused on the role of microorganisms associated to roots, or rhizobiomes, in the weathering of silicate rocks at the tropics. The weathering of these rocks, especially when they have high concentrations of Calcium and Magnesium is known to affect the short- and the long Carbon cycles.
